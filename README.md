## Description  

This application can be used to build your team and access their informaion when needed! You can add a manager, multiple engineers, and multiple interns. The prompts will ask diffrent questions based on the type of member (engineer/intern). Engineers will have a github and interns have a school field. When finished adding members to your team it will generate a html page fully styled and will put the Manager at the top followed by the engineers which are then followed by interns, making almost a tree/pyramid styled member list! Sending emails to your members are as easy as clicking their email, as it will bring up your default emailer so you can quickly send a message! Also your engineers github accounts can simply be clicked on to take you to their page. All of your team wrapped up in one page!
